# File Simulation System

## Introduction
This project involves the development of a file simulation system on Ubuntu Linux. The system will be implemented using programming languages such as C or Python, leveraging the underlying capabilities of the Ubuntu 
operating system. It will employ a well-defined design and architecture, utilizing appropriate data structures and algorithms to simulate file system operations. The user interface will be carefully designed, encompassing 
either a command-line or graphical interface, allowing users to interact with the simulated file system seamlessly. Key features of the system will include file creation, deletion, modification, and navigation. 
Furthermore, advanced functionalities such as file permissions, symbolic links, and file system journaling may also be implemented to enhance the simulation experience.
